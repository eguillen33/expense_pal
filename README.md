Linting
ChatGPT said:
Are you referring to linting for a specific programming language or tool, like Python (using flake8 or black), JavaScript (using ESLint), or YAML files related to Kubernetes? Let me know what you need help with!





You said:
flake8
It looks like flake8 isn't available in the execution environment. However, you can run flake8 on your local machine by following these steps:

Install flake8 (if you haven’t already):

sh
Copy
pip install flake8
Run flake8 on your script:

sh
Copy
flake8 expense_pal.py
If you want more details, run it with additional options:

sh
Copy
flake8 expense_pal.py --max-line-length=100 --statistics
Would you like me to manually review the script for common linting issues instead? ​​

I want to include it at stage in my cicd pipeline
ChatGPT said:
To integrate flake8 linting into your CircleCI pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Update Your config.yml File
Modify your CircleCI config (config.yml) to include a new job for linting.

Updated config.yml
yaml
Copy
version: 2.1

jobs:
  lint:
    docker:
      - image: python:3.10  # Use a Python image
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install Dependencies
          command: pip install flake8
      - run:
          name: Run Flake8 Linting
          command: flake8 expense_pal.py --max-line-length=100 --statistics

  expense-pal:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:current
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "Expense Pal"
          command: echo "Welcome to the Expense Pal Test!"

workflows:
  expense-pal-workflow:
    jobs:
      - lint  # Run linting before running other jobs
      - expense-pal:
          requires:
            - lint  # Runs only if linting passes
2. Explanation of Changes
lint job:

Uses Python 3.10 as the execution environment.
Checks out your code.
Installs flake8.
Runs flake8 on expense_pal.py.
If linting fails, the pipeline stops and reports errors.
Dependency Handling (requires):

expense-pal job will only run if linting passes.
If flake8 detects linting issues, the build fails at the lint step.
3. Push Your Changes
Once you've updated config.yml, push your changes:

sh
Copy
git add .circleci/config.yml
git commit -m "Added flake8 linting to CircleCI"
git push origin main
This will trigger your CI/CD pipeline on CircleCI with linting before running the main job.

Would you like to enforce stricter linting rules (e.g., PEP8 compliance, ignoring certain rules)?





You said:
Pipeline is failing because of some mild lint errors. How can I relax the lint rules?
ChatGPT said:
If your CircleCI pipeline is failing due to mild lint errors, you can relax the linting rules in the following ways:

1. Ignore Specific Warnings/Errors
You can configure flake8 to ignore certain errors by using:

Command-line flags
A .flake8 or setup.cfg file
Option 1: Ignore Errors in config.yml
Modify the lint job in your .circleci/config.yml:

yaml
Copy
  - run:
      name: Run Flake8 Linting
      command: flake8 expense_pal.py --max-line-length=100 --ignore=E501,W503
--max-line-length=100 → Allows longer lines before flagging.
--ignore=E501,W503 → Ignores:
E501 (Line too long)
W503 (Line break before binary operator)
2. Use a .flake8 Configuration File
Instead of passing flags in config.yml, create a .flake8 file in your repo’s root:

ini
Copy
[flake8]
max-line-length = 100
ignore = E501, W503
exclude = .git, __pycache__, venv
Then update your CircleCI config.yml to use it:

yaml
Copy
  - run:
      name: Run Flake8 Linting
      command: flake8
Benefit: Keeps linting rules consistent across environments.

3. Use per-file-ignores (Selective Ignoring)
If some specific files (like expense_pal.py) contain ignorable errors, update .flake8:

ini
Copy
[flake8]
max-line-length = 100
ignore = E501, W503
per-file-ignores =
    expense_pal.py: E302, E305  # Example: Ignores missing blank lines
4. Allow Warnings But Fail on Errors
To fail only on serious errors but allow warnings:

yaml
Copy
  - run:
      name: Run Flake8 Linting (Warnings Allowed)
      command: flake8 || echo "Lint warnings detected, but not failing build."
This ensures warnings don’t break the pipeline.

5. Run flake8 in Non-Strict Mode
If you want flake8 to show warnings but not fail the build, modify:

yaml
Copy
  - run:
      name: Run Flake8 Linting (Non-Strict)
      command: flake8 || true
|| true prevents flake8 from failing the job.
Final Thoughts
If you only want to relax a few rules, use --ignore=E501,W503 in config.yml.
If you want global rules, create a .flake8 file.
If you want warnings but no failures, use flake8 || true.
Would you like help tuning specific rules to match your style preferences? 🚀

How can I break this single line piece of code into multi-lines?
summary = f"Total Income: ${abs(total_income)}\nTotal Expenses: ${abs(total_expenses)}\nBalance: ${total_income - total_expenses}"
ChatGPT said:
You can break this long f-string into multiple lines using parentheses or the multi-line f-string syntax for better readability. Here are two common ways:

Option 1: Using Parentheses (Recommended)
python
Copy
summary = (
    f"Total Income: ${abs(total_income)}\n"
    f"Total Expenses: ${abs(total_expenses)}\n"
    f"Balance: ${total_income - total_expenses}"
)
Parentheses allow implicit string concatenation.
Each line is a separate f-string.
Option 2: Using Triple Quotes
python
Copy
summary = f"""Total Income: ${abs(total_income)}
Total Expenses: ${abs(total_expenses)}
Balance: ${total_income - total_expenses}"""
Uses triple quotes (""" or ''').
Keeps newlines as part of the string.
Option 3: Using join()
python
Copy
summary = "\n".join([
    f"Total Income: ${abs(total_income)}",
    f"Total Expenses: ${abs(total_expenses)}",
    f"Balance: ${total_income - total_expenses}"
])
Uses list comprehension + join().
Explicitly defines separators.
Which One Should You Use?
✅ Option 1 (Parentheses) → Best for clean, readable code.
✅ Option 2 (Triple Quotes) → Good for multi-line strings where newline format matters.
✅ Option 3 (join()) → Good if dealing with dynamically generated strings.
Would you like me to lint the entire script for other improvements? 🚀





You said:
I want to deploy this onto a K8s sandbox cluster
ChatGPT said:
To deploy your Expense Pal application onto a Kubernetes (K8s) sandbox cluster, follow these steps:

1. Containerize the Application
You'll need a Dockerfile to package your Python application into a container.

Create Dockerfile
In the root directory of your project, create a file named Dockerfile:

dockerfile
Copy
# Use an official Python runtime as base image
FROM python:3.10

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . .

# Install required dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Expose port 5000 (or the port your app runs on)
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "expense_pal.py"]
Ensure you create a requirements.txt file containing:

nginx
Copy
pandas
matplotlib
tk
2. Build & Push the Docker Image
Run the following commands to build and push your image:

sh
Copy
# Build Docker image
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/expense-pal:latest .

# Push image to Docker Hub (or any container registry)
docker push your-dockerhub-username/expense-pal:latest
Replace your-dockerhub-username with your actual Docker Hub username.

3. Create Kubernetes Deployment YAML
Create a Kubernetes manifest file deployment.yaml:

yaml
Copy
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: expense-pal
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: expense-pal
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: expense-pal
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: expense-pal
          image: your-dockerhub-username/expense-pal:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5000
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: "256Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: expense-pal-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: expense-pal
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 5000
4. Apply the Deployment to Kubernetes
Run the following commands:

sh
Copy
# Apply the deployment
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

# Verify pod status
kubectl get pods

# Get external service URL
kubectl get svc expense-pal-service
5. Access Your Application
If running locally, use kubectl port-forward:

sh
Copy
kubectl port-forward svc/expense-pal-service 8080:80
Then visit http://localhost:8080.

If using a K8s cloud cluster, use the external IP from:

sh
Copy
kubectl get svc expense-pal-service
Next Steps
Add Persistent Volume (PVC) for data storage.
Use ConfigMaps & Secrets for managing sensitive data.
Enable auto-scaling based on load.

You said:
I want to build the docker image as part of the pipeline
ChatGPT said:
To build and push the Docker image as part of your CircleCI pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Update config.yml to Include Docker Build and Push
Modify your .circleci/config.yml file to add a Docker build and push step:

yaml
Copy
version: 2.1

executors:
  docker-executor:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/python:3.10  # Use Python 3.10 with Docker

jobs:
  lint:
    executor: docker-executor
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install Dependencies
          command: pip install flake8
      - run:
          name: Run Flake8 Linting
          command: flake8 expense_pal.py --max-line-length=100 --ignore=E501,W503

  build-and-push:
    executor: docker-executor
    steps:
      - checkout
      - setup_remote_docker
      - run:
          name: Build Docker Image
          command: |
            docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/expense-pal:latest .
      - run:
          name: Authenticate & Push to Docker Hub
          command: |
            echo "$DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME" --password-stdin
            docker push your-dockerhub-username/expense-pal:latest

workflows:
  expense-pal-workflow:
    jobs:
      - lint
      - build-and-push:
          requires:
            - lint
2. Add Environment Variables in CircleCI
Since Docker Hub requires authentication, you'll need to store your credentials securely in CircleCI.

Go to CircleCI Dashboard → Open your project.
Navigate to Project Settings → Environment Variables.
Add the following variables:
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME → Your Docker Hub username.
DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD → Your Docker Hub password.
🚨 Security Tip: Avoid hardcoding credentials in your config.yml. Using environment variables keeps them safe.

3. Push Your Changes
After updating your CircleCI config, commit and push:

sh
Copy
git add .circleci/config.yml
git commit -m "Add Docker build & push to CircleCI pipeline"
git push origin main
This will trigger your CI/CD pipeline, which will: ✅ Lint the code with flake8.
✅ Build the Docker image.
✅ Push the image to Docker Hub (if linting passes).

4. Deploy Image in Kubernetes (deployment.yaml)
Once the image is pushed, ensure your Kubernetes deployment file (deployment.yaml) pulls the latest image:

yaml
Copy
containers:
  - name: expense-pal
    image: your-dockerhub-username/expense-pal:latest
    imagePullPolicy: Always  # Always pull latest version
Then, apply the update:

sh
Copy
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Next Steps
Want automatic deployment after a successful build? Add a Kubernetes deployment step in the pipeline.
Need a private registry (like AWS ECR/GCR)? Modify the Docker login step accordingly.
Would you like help adding auto-deploy to Kubernetes after the image is built? 🚀





You said:
And I want that stage to also upload the docker image a registry
ChatGPT said:
To build, push the Docker image to a registry, and deploy to Kubernetes as part of your CircleCI pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Update .circleci/config.yml
Modify your CircleCI pipeline to: ✅ Lint the code.
✅ Build & push the Docker image to a registry (Docker Hub, AWS ECR, or GCR).
✅ Deploy the image to a Kubernetes cluster.

            - lint
      - deploy-to-k8s:
          requires:
            - build-and-push
2. Add Environment Variables in CircleCI
Since Docker Hub and Kubernetes need authentication, store the credentials securely:

Go to CircleCI Dashboard → Open your project.
Navigate to Project Settings → Environment Variables.
Add the following variables:
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME → Your Docker Hub username.
DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD → Your Docker Hub password.
KUBE_CONFIG → Base64-encoded Kubernetes config (see below).
3. Get Kubernetes Config (KUBE_CONFIG)
To deploy to a remote Kubernetes cluster, get your Kubeconfig file:

Run:

sh
Copy
cat ~/.kube/config | base64
Copy the output and store it as KUBE_CONFIG in CircleCI.

4. Push Changes to Git
Commit and push your updated CircleCI config:

sh
Copy
git add .circleci/config.yml
git commit -m "Add Docker build, push, and Kubernetes deployment"
git push origin main
5. What Happens Next?
Now, your CI/CD pipeline will: ✅ Run Flake8 linting.
✅ Build & push the Docker image to Docker Hub.
✅ Deploy the updated image to Kubernetes.

Bonus: Use AWS ECR (Alternative Registry)
If you’re using AWS ECR instead of Docker Hub, update the build-and-push job:

yaml
Copy
  build-and-push:
    executor: docker-executor
    steps:
      - checkout
      - setup_remote_docker
      - run:
          name: Authenticate to AWS ECR
          command: |
            aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-ecr-repo>
      - run:
          name: Build Docker Image
          command: |
            docker build -t <your-ecr-repo>/expense-pal:latest .
      - run:
          name: Push to AWS ECR
          command: |
            docker push <your-ecr-repo>/expense-pal:latest
Make sure AWS credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID & AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) are stored in CircleCI environment variables.

🔹 What’s Changed?
Added Docker Login
Uses environment variables (DOCKERHUB_USERNAME & DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD).
Pushes Docker Image to Docker Hub
Runs docker push edguillen/expense-pal:latest after login.
Ensures Expense Pal Runs After Build-and-Push
expense-pal job only runs if Docker image is built successfully.
🔹 How to Set Up Environment Variables in CircleCI
Go to CircleCI Dashboard → Open your project.
Navigate to Project Settings → Environment Variables.
Add:
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME → Your Docker Hub username.
DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD → Your Docker Hub password.
🔹 How to Verify Everything Works
Once you commit & push, check the CircleCI pipeline:

sh
Copy
git add .circleci/config.yml
git commit -m "Added Docker push to CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
✅ Linting (flake8) runs first.
✅ Docker image builds & pushes to Docker Hub.
✅ expense-pal job runs only if Docker push succeeds.
🔹 How to Pull the Image Manually
After the pipeline succeeds, pull the image locally:

sh
Copy
docker pull edguillen/expense-pal:latest

circleci env var set DOCKERHUB_USERNAME "your-dockerhub-username" --project your-github-repo
circleci env var set DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD "your-dockerhub-password" --project your-github-repo
Replace "your-dockerhub-username" and "your-dockerhub-password" with your actual credentials.

🔹 Method 3: Set Variables in .circleci/config.yml (Not Recommended)
You could define them directly in your pipeline, but this is insecure:

yaml
Copy
environment:
  DOCKERHUB_USERNAME: "your-dockerhub-username"
  DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD: "your-dockerhub-password"
❌ Never store sensitive credentials in your config file. Always use CircleCI's environment variables.

🔹 How to Test if Variables Are Set
After adding them, check if they work:

sh
Copy
echo "$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME"
echo "$DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD"
In your CircleCI job, you can add a debug step:

yaml
Copy
- run:
    name: Debug Environment Variables
    command: echo "DockerHub username is $DOCKERHUB_USERNAME"
🚨 Note: Never print $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD in logs.

🔹 Next Steps
Once you've set the variables, push your code to trigger the pipeline:

sh
Copy
git add .circleci/config.yml
git commit -m "Configured Docker login in CircleCI"
git push origin main
✅ Your pipeline will now build & push images to Docker Hub automatically!

You said:
If I used github to login to dockerhub, what would my password be?
ChatGPT said:
If you used GitHub to log in to Docker Hub, your password is not your GitHub password. Instead, you need to generate an Access Token for authentication.

🔹 Steps to Get a Docker Hub Access Token
Since Docker Hub no longer supports password authentication for CLI logins, follow these steps to get an Access Token:

Go to Docker Hub:

Open Docker Hub and log in with GitHub.
Navigate to Security Settings:

Click on your profile icon (top-right) → "Account Settings".
Go to the "Security" tab.
Generate a New Access Token:

Under "Access Tokens", click "New Access Token".
Give it a name (e.g., CircleCI-Pipeline).
Click "Generate".
Copy the Token:

Once generated, copy the token immediately.
You won’t be able to see it again!
Use This Token Instead of Your Password:

When setting DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD in CircleCI, use this token.
🔹 Updating Your CircleCI Environment Variables
Now, add the token to CircleCI:

Go to CircleCI Dashboard → Open your project.
Navigate to Project Settings → Environment Variables.
Add:
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME → Your Docker Hub username (same as in your profile).
DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD → Paste the access token from Docker Hub.
🔹 How to Test Login Using Your Token
If you want to test before running it in CircleCI, try logging in locally:

sh
Copy
docker login -u "your-dockerhub-username" --password-stdin <<< "your-access-token"
If successful, you should see:

nginx
Copy
Login Succeeded
🚀 Next Steps
✅ Use this token in CircleCI instead of your password.
✅ Your pipeline can now build & push Docker images securely.

Let me know if you run into any issues! 🚀





You said:
I see 'User Settings' and then 'Privacy & Security' or also 'Personal Access Tokens'. This is in the Circle-CI portal
ChatGPT said:
You're in the right place! Since you're setting up Docker authentication in CircleCI, follow these steps to create a Personal Access Token in Docker Hub and then add it to CircleCI.

🔹 Steps to Generate a Docker Hub Access Token
Since you logged into Docker Hub using GitHub, your password won't work for CLI authentication. You need to create a Personal Access Token instead.

1️⃣ Generate an Access Token in Docker Hub
Go to Docker Hub:

Open Docker Hub and log in using GitHub.
Navigate to "Account Settings":

Click on your profile icon (top-right).
Select "Account Settings".
Go to "Security":

In the left-hand menu, click "Security".
Create a Personal Access Token:

Scroll down to "Access Tokens" and click "New Access Token".
Give it a name (e.g., CircleCI-Pipeline).
Click "Generate".
Copy the Token:

Important: Copy the token now, because you won't be able to see it again after leaving the page.
🔹 Steps to Add the Token to CircleCI
Now, add the token as an environment variable in CircleCI.

1️⃣ Open CircleCI Environment Variables
Go to CircleCI:

Open CircleCI and log in.
Navigate to Your Project:

Click on the project where you’re setting up Docker authentication.
Open "Project Settings":

Click the gear icon (⚙) in the top-right.
Go to "Environment Variables":

Click on the "Environment Variables" tab.
Add Two New Variables:

DOCKERHUB_USERNAME → Your Docker Hub username.
DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD → Paste the token you generated in Docker Hub.
🔹 Verify Everything Works
After adding the credentials, verify them in CircleCI by running this command in your config.yml:

yaml
Copy
  - run:
      name: Debug Docker Login
      command: |
        echo "$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME"
        echo "${#DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD}" | sed 's/./*/g'  # Masks password length
🔐 Never print the actual token in logs for security.

Now, push your code to trigger the pipeline:

sh
Copy
git add .circleci/config.yml
git commit -m "Added Docker login in CircleCI"
git push origin main
🔹 What Happens Next?
✅ Linting (flake8) runs first.
✅ Docker image builds & pushes to Docker Hub using the token.
✅ Pipeline runs without login failures.

Let me know if you hit any snags! 🚀





You said:
What access permissions should I give the dockerhub token
ChatGPT said:
For your Docker Hub Access Token, you should grant the minimum necessary permissions to allow your CircleCI pipeline to authenticate, build, and push images to your Docker Hub repository.

🔹 Recommended Permissions for Docker Hub Token
When creating the token in Docker Hub, choose the following permissions:

Permission	Required?	Reason
Read	✅ Yes	Allows the pipeline to pull Docker images (if needed).
Write	✅ Yes	Required to push images to your repository.
Delete	❌ No	Not needed unless your pipeline is cleaning up images.
🔹 How to Set Permissions in Docker Hub
Go to Docker Hub → Login
Click Profile Icon → "Account Settings"
Go to "Security" → "Access Tokens"
Click "New Access Token"
Set Token Name (e.g., CircleCI-Pipeline)
Set Token Scope (Permissions):
✅ Read
✅ Write
❌ Delete (Not needed)
Click "Generate"
Copy the token immediately and store it securely!
🔹 Why Not Grant "Delete" Permission?
Security Risk: If compromised, the token could be used to delete images.
Not Necessary for CI/CD: You only need read/write for pushing images.
🔹 Final Check
After adding the token to CircleCI as DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD, test it in your pipeline:

yaml
Copy
  - run:
      name: Verify Docker Login
      command: docker login -u "$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME" --password-stdin <<< "$DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD"
If it works, you’ll see:

nginx
Copy
Login Succeeded
✅ Now, your pipeline can push images to Docker Hub safely with minimal permissions! 🚀 Let me know if you need any adjustments.





You said:
I want to build and push only if expense-pal runs successfully
ChatGPT said:
To ensure that the Docker build and push step only runs if expense-pal passes successfully, we need to reorder dependencies in the CircleCI workflow.

🔹 Updated config.yml
yaml
Copy
version: 2.1

executors:
  docker-executor:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/python:3.12

  expense-pal:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:current
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "Expense Pal welcome note"
          command: echo "Welcome to the Expense Pal CI/CD pipeline!"

# Orchestrate jobs using workflows
workflows:
  expense-pal-workflow:
    jobs:
      - lint
      - expense-pal:
          requires:
            - lint
      - build-and-push:
          requires:
            - expense-pal  # 🚀 Runs ONLY if expense-pal passes
🔹 What This Change Does
✅ lint runs first
✅ expense-pal runs only if linting passes
✅ build-and-push only runs if expense-pal passes successfully

If expense-pal fails (e.g., unit tests fail), the Docker image will NOT be built or pushed.

🔹 What Happens in Your Pipeline?
Linting Runs → If successful ✅, move to expense-pal
Expense-Pal Job Runs → Runs tests & dependencies
If Expense-Pal Passes ✅ → Build & Push Docker Image
If Expense-Pal Fails ❌ → Stop Pipeline (no image pushed)
🔹 Next Steps
✅ If you need more tests, add them to expense-pal before building the image.
✅ If you want conditional tagging (e.g., latest or staging), I can help add that.
🚀 Now, your pipeline only builds and pushes if everything is green! Let me know if you need further improvements.

Getting this error:
"Dockerfile:7
--------------------
   5 |     COPY . .
   6 |     
   7 | >>> RUN --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   8 |     
   9 |     EXPOSE 5000
--------------------
ERROR: failed to solve: dockerfile parse error on line 7: unknown flag: no-cache-dir

Exited with code exit status 1"
ChatGPT said:
The error is caused by an incorrect Dockerfile syntax. The RUN --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt line is invalid because:

RUN requires a command (like pip install).
The --no-cache-dir flag belongs to pip install, not RUN.
🔹 Fix Your Dockerfile
Modify your Dockerfile as follows:

dockerfile
Copy
# Use an official Python runtime as base image
FROM python:3.10

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . .

# Install required dependencies (fixing the incorrect line)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Expose port 5000 (or the port your app runs on)
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "expense_pal.py"]
🔹 What Was Wrong?
❌ Wrong:

dockerfile
Copy
RUN --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt  # INVALID
✅ Correct:

dockerfile
Copy
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
Fixed RUN syntax: Added pip install before --no-cache-dir.
Ensured requirements.txt exists: The file should be in the root directory.
🔹 Next Steps
Update the Dockerfile with the fix.
Commit & push the fix:
sh
Copy
git add Dockerfile
git commit -m "Fix Dockerfile install syntax"
git push origin main
Trigger a new CircleCI build and verify the fix.
